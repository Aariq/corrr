Title: Correlations in R
Description: corrr is a package for exploring
  correlation matrices in R. It makes it possible
  to easily perform routine tasks when exploring
  correlation matrices such as focusing on the
  correlations of certain variables against others,
  or arranging the matrix in terms of the strength
  of the correlations, and so on. `corrr` also
  provides visualisation methods for extracting
  useful information such as variable clustering
  and latent dimensionality.
